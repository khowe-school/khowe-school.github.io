<h1>My Current Skills</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>As any artist trying to grow can tell you, art is never really something a person can master. And while I do see my efforts for what they are, I can also acknowledge that there are things I can improve on, and thus I deem them harder and will be less likely to accept or finish faster. Whether or not this page changes down the line is up to question, as growth is not linear.</p>

	<p>It is easy for me to self-deprecate, so in an effort to keep this a positive workspace for myself and others, I prefer to list what I am strongest in, rather than my pitfalls.</p>

	<p>Things I am artistically sound in:</p>
<ol> 
  <li>Digital art. It is the only medium I feel I am skilled enough in to use professionally</li>
		<li>Most animals (anthropomorphized characters are more of what I’m used to working on, but I can work with regular animals as well. Yes I know I said in my big nos page that horses are hard. That was a full joke)</li>
		<li>Clean, bold lineart with semithick to thick consistency (colored or plain black)</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>If something you want drawn doesn’t fit at least one of these categories in your vision, I’d recommend asking for work from someone else, though if you’re certain that I am the one to achieve what you want, you are welcome to ask me specific questions when inquiring about what you want. I will only do work I know I can make look decent.</p>

	<p>Here are a few diverse examples of my work:</p>
