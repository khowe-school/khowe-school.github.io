	<h1>My Big No's</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Let's start with what I won’t do. If you want me to draw something, and it falls under these categories, I will simply decline the offer:</p>

	<ol>

		<li><strong>Art that promotes hate speech or intolerance against marginalized groups (feels like this should be a given but you never know)</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Art that is more than mildly suggestive in nature, as I find it more difficult to do correctly and it makes me personally uncomfortable (what reads as suggestive and not suggestive is at my discretion).</strong></li> 
		<li><strong>Stuff with outright inappropriate sexual themes is out of the question. Things like cartoonish gore and violence are at my discretion.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Overcomplicated designs like complex mechanisms or fabrics with small, intricate patterns or folds (this one is more subjective than a definite no like the previous three, be sure to ask).</strong></li> 
		<li><strong>If you ask me to draw you a sheet of hands or feet in various poses I will find you. Or horses. Horses are ridiculous. Go look at a picture of a horse and tell me that they're not. You can’t.</strong></li>
	</ol>


	<p>...Ok, that last one was more of a joke. I don’t actually have that many restrictions on what I will accept. Of course, if I feel a project is too wide a scope for me to do in a timely manner, I will advise you accordingly. All I ask is that you are patient with me.</p>
