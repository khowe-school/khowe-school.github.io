	<h1>Pricing and Terms</h1>
	
	<p>Prices for my commissions are, for the most part, non negotiable. For more complicated pieces I might increase the price as I see fit. If I am feeling special, I will advertise possible discounts. For now though, the prices are as follows:</p>
	
	<table summary="my table of prices">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Simple Sketch</th>
      <th scope="col">Line Art&nbsp;</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Simple Color</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Shading/Colored Lineart</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Previous Tier + Background</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Add a Character</th>
      <th scope="col">&nbsp;Simple Background on It's Own</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10$&nbsp;</td>
      <td>&nbsp;15$</td>
      <td>&nbsp;20$</td>
      <td>25$&nbsp;</td>
      <td>30$&nbsp;</td>
      <td>+5$ *</td>
      <td nowrap="nowrap">&nbsp;10$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
	
	<p><em>**Plus 5 dollars for every character added plus 5 for every tier up it is (up until added background)</em></p>
	
	<p>Payment will be in half installments. Half of the original price will be paid before I start working, and the other half will be given before I give you the finished work. In the case of a family or medical or disastrous event in my personal life during my work, I will refund the initial payment if I find that I will not complete a piece properly or timely. This means you will not receive any finished, unwatermarked piece. </p>
	
	<p>You may be saying, watermarks? What's this about watermarks? Well, to avoid even the slightest hint of scamming, I am going to watermark wips as I see fit. It will not be enough to damage the overall viewing of the piece but it will be noticeable, in hard to remove places. Please understand that it is only for the sake of my own job security that I do this. I often believe in the best in people, but this market is notorious for having folks in it that like to exploit already struggling creators, and I will not let myself be part of that cycle, if I can help it.</p>
