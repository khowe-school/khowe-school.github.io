<h1>Welcome, Everyone</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
<h3>My name is Katelyn (though I also like going by Raine or other variations of that name).</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<p style="text-align: left"> I am a hobbyist artist, currently going to EMU and working on getting a degree in things like game design and animation (which their SAG program provides). With this degree, I hope to:</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li style="text-align: left">Find an easier way to make my creative ideas a reality</li>
		<li style="text-align: left">Become a game developer and work on developing games (with a team or otherwise)</li>
		<li style="text-align: left">Possibly make a little money on the side with the previous two goals</li>
	</ul>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<h3>Personal History</h3>
	
	<p>I was born in a small town that I shall not name near midnight on August 21st, 2005. I am the only baby in my immediate family that was born at night. I currently live somewhere else, with my parents, two little brothers, and a cat that I love like a smaller, hairier brother. I also have an older sister, but she has her own family now, so I see her less often.</p>

	<p>As a child, art has always been one of the things I loved most about life. I loved drawing, coloring, writing stories, and making big overcomplicated worlds in my own head. Sometimes, this has led me to neglect other aspects of my life, such as relationships and noncreative academic work. This didn’t stop me from (mostly) excelling in school, graduating high school with a higher than average GPA (which I have mostly kept the same in my college years, in spite of the stress the change from high school has caused me).</p>
	
	<p>I take inspiration from the various cartoons I’ve watched over the years, but none have specifically integrated into my style entirely. I find myself inspired year after year, and with that my style fluctuates and gets more variety. I'm more keen to look into the abstract and work with simple shapes, rather than be realistic in my art. I find realism harder to understand, and thus it does not come as easily to me as other design choices.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	
	<h3>Commission Work?</h3>
	
	<p>Right now I only really draw what interests me, but I have started the process of working out how I want to price possible commission work if I were to ever take it. You can view the basic information on what I may offer, what I will or won’t draw, possible prices, my artistic strengths/limitations, and more.</p>

	<p>As a disclaimer, I am going to state here that communicating is not the strongest suit in my closet. So, for the most part, I will only be communicating through sending works in progress during the stages of my creative process, and asking for feedback. It is my aim to create what my commissioner wants 100%, so don’t feel afraid to correct a detail or ask for revisions.</p>

	<p>I will be clear, though, that once a piece is in its final stages (if it is more complicated with things like full shading and backgrounds), I will decline bigger structural revisions like changing poses or full color palettes, as I respect my own time just as much as I respect yours. (I will do separate wip checks for backgrounds, if applicable. They will often not be as complicated).</p>

	<p>Also, as a final addendum, I do not give permission to anyone who commissions me or anyone who views my art in general to use any of my art for AI generative models/AI related content. Do not bother negotiating this, as I will cut contact with you immediately if you even try.</p>

 	<p>Now that the basic information about me and what I do is out of the way, here's more detailed information.</p>
